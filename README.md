# Power Automate Flow to reassign ownership for Power App
This package contains a sample flow which looks for disabled users in Office 365, searches through all environments for any Power Platform apps owned by the disabled user, reassigns the app to the flow owner, then sends an email confirmation to the Admin making them aware that app ownership was reassigned.

To use this package, download the .zip package and import into your environment. Be sure to set and declare varibles for Environment Name and connections during the import.
